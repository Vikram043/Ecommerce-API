<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This API supports various e-commerce operations, including product and category listing, product details, cart management, and order processing. It also handles user authentication and token management

### Built With

* Backend: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

4. **Express.js Framework:**
   - Use Express.js as the backend framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
   - Implement middleware for authentication and error handling.

5. **Data Security:**
   - Encrypt sensitive data like user passwords before storage.
   - Implement secure authentication mechanisms.

6. **API Documentation:**
   - Create clear and concise API documentation, including endpoint descriptions and request/response examples.
   - Utilize tools like Swagger for easy reference.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling with appropriate status codes and error messages.
   - Handle edge cases and provide informative error responses.

8. **Rate Limiting :**
   - Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse and maintain server stability.

10. **Scalability Considerations:**
    - Design the backend with scalability in mind to handle increased traffic and data growth.

11. **Security Best Practices:**
    - Follow security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.

12. **Modular Codebase:**
    - Organize code into reusable and maintainable modules.

13. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
    - Configure CORS to enable secure cross-origin requests.

Follow these steps to get your Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB backend up and running.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- MongoDB server installed and running locally or on a remote server.
- Git installed (optional, for cloning the repository).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   cd your-backend-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install the project dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

### Configuration

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your environment variables. You can use a tool like `.env.example` as a template.
   - Configure environment variables such as database connection details, JWT secret, and any other project-specific settings.

### Running the Application

5. **Start the Server:**
